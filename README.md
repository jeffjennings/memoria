# memoria
A simple GUI to replicate flashcards for memorizing Italian vocabulary, grammar (especially conjugation/declension) and phrases. Entries are added on a per chapter basis as I work through the Italian textbooks and workbooks of _New Italian Espresso_ and _Nuovo Espresso_, as well as the grammar books _Italian Grammar in Practice_, _English Grammar for Students of Italian_, and _Pocket Italian Grammar_. 

The code produces a GUI with a grid of flashcards in either Italian or English entries that belong to one or more specified (or random) chapters in the above books; clicking on the entry shows its English/Italian counterpart, or in the case of grammar the relevant forms.

A great Italian-English dictionary is [WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/iten/). 
And a great grammar reference for verb conjugation across all tenses is [Virgilio](https://sapere.virgilio.it/parole/coniuga-verbi/).
